# PrimeDistro

PrimeDistro is a mock distribution company website designed to practice and showcase modern web design skills.  
It features a clean layout, easy navigation, and covers a wide range of product categories.

## 📦 Project Overview

This website represents a fictional distribution company that deals in multiple sectors including:

- Food & Beverages
- Home Care
- Health & Wellness
- Baby Products
- Pet Supplies
- Beverages
- Beauty & Cosmetics
- Retail Merchandise

Users visiting the site can explore categories and initiate contact depending on who they are —  
whether they are **manufacturers**, **wholesalers**, **recruiters**, or have **other inquiries**.

## ✨ Features

- Simple and professional UI
- Smooth navigation between sections
- "Get Started" options for different user types
- Static form pages (currently non-functional, no form handlers integrated yet)

## 🔧 Built With

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 How to View

You can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project locally.

## 📌 Note

- Forms are currently static and do not submit data.
- No backend or form handling services (like Formspree) have been connected yet.

## 🎯 Future Plans

- Make the forms fully functional (maybe using Formspree or a custom backend)
- Add form validation and success messages without redirection
- Minor UI improvements based on feedback

> This project is part of a personal initiative to practice building real-world web layouts and share the learning journey publicly.
